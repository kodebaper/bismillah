[{"content":"explaintation about this series It should be remembered that this article is a series of lessons from part 1 on ethical hacking to part 7 that I studied, to summarize so that there is not too much discussion I decided to shorten the discussion\nArticles on the hacking series are not recommended for those who are very beginners, I do not explain with detailed pictures or videos and also do not explain the basics of the Kali Linux operating system starting from how to change directories and run the command line. I hope those who study this hacking series are familiar with open-source operating systems so that further on in the next part you won\u0026rsquo;t experience too many difficulties.\nparts 1 to part 7 are as follows This article is a summary of the discussion on ethical hacking material in parts 1 to part 7 that I have learned, while the points that I got during learning parts 1 to part 7 are as follows:\ninstall virtual box and prepare virtual machine installation of kali linux os in vm understanding the basic Kali Linux commands and studying the directories and contents inside the characteristics of the Kali Linux operating system. ethical hacking session starting from information gathering just the first stage of information in learning to do hacking after all the preparations have been completed starting from reconnaissance or gathering information (information gathering)\nIn the information gathering that must be identified, namely the IP address of the attack target, physical address, email address, username, etc. They also use tools like whois, what web, theharvester, hunter.io, or Sherlock. it also includes making its tools with the Python programming language to find out the location of the target server of the attack target in this case a website.\nthe earliest stage of preparation for learning ethical hacking is preparing a virtual machine in which we will embed a special operating system to carry out hacking activities. After the vm is installed on a laptop or computer device, then install the Kali Linux operating system on the vm.\nvirtual machine vm has been installed, and we have also installed the operating system for carrying out the attack, let\u0026rsquo;s now it\u0026rsquo;s time to explore and understand how to use the Kali Linux operating system. This stage is carried out for those who don\u0026rsquo;t understand and are new to Kali Linux. There\u0026rsquo;s no need to rush into the hacking part immediately, but need help understanding how to use the Kali Linux operating system as the most basic and primary weapon. Therefore, first, get to know what Kali Linux is, learn all the existing directories and the functions of each directory, get to know the command lines for editing files, creating files, deleting files, and moving directories to other directories (this method is the most basic and mandatory in know and understand) after all this you can and get used to letting\u0026rsquo;s shorten the time to carry out hacking activities by starting to enter the next step\nwe will proceed to the information gathering step first, in this session we will create a program with the Python programming language which we will run then the program will be able to track the location of the server a website is placed on, in this case, this information starts from obtaining information IP Address then the location information.\nfor that, I will continue making this program in the discussion of articles in the next part.

Course Penetration Testing \u0026ldquo;Red Team\u0026rdquo;.\nI think the initial notes here are important so that I don\u0026rsquo;t get out of the discussion of the articles that I will load on this blog, here is a list of materials that I will learn in the Penetration Testing Course\nwhat was learned?

Making this tool also aims at Information Gathering to find the IP address of a website and the geolocation of the server where the target website is placed.\nwe simply create a file with the name we want with the file extension [.py] in this case I gave my file name [checker.py] The contents of this file are as follows\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 import socket import requests import pprint import json hostname = input(\u0026#39;Enter a domain name\u0026#34; \u0026#39;) ip_address = socket.gethostbyname(hostname) request_url = \u0026#39;\u0026lt;https://geolocation-db.com/jsonp/\u0026gt;\u0026#39; + ip_address response = requests.get(request_url) geolocation = response.content.decode() geolocation = geolocation.split(\u0026#34;(\u0026#34;)[1].strip(\u0026#34;)\u0026#34;) geolocation = json.loads(geolocation) for k,v in geolocation.items(): pprint.pprint(str(k) + \u0026#39; : \u0026#39; + str(v)) after creat code programs after files checker.py is already filled with lines of code as above, then save and it\u0026rsquo;s time to check whether the tools we have created can run properly. what we need to do first we have to move to the directory where the checker.py is created, in this case, I put my files in the Documents directory then we input this command in the\n$ python terminal checker.py then we enter the name of the target website and the results are as below.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 ┌──(infosec㉿infosec)-[~/Documents] └─$ python checker[.py](\u0026lt;http://geoloc.py/\u0026gt;) Enter a domain name\u0026#34; [kominfo.go.id](\u0026lt;http://kominfo.go.id/\u0026gt;) \u0026#39;country_code : US\u0026#39; \u0026#39;country_name : United States\u0026#39; \u0026#39;city : None\u0026#39; \u0026#39;postal : None\u0026#39; \u0026#39;latitude : 37.751\u0026#39; \u0026#39;longitude : -97.822\u0026#39; \u0026#39;IPv4 : 45.60.36.49\u0026#39; \u0026#39;state : None\u0026#39; will continue to the next article from the results above we can see some complete information such as IP address or geo-location. Until the discussion of this article is here, I will continue the discussion of information gathering in the next article\n","date":"2019-03-05T00:00:00Z","image":"http://localhost:1313/p/how-to-track-an-ip-checker-tool-in-python/recon3_hu889f54b6541cd963dfcd75a2f95f6ed5_38566_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/p/how-to-track-an-ip-checker-tool-in-python/","title":"how to track an IP checker tool in python"}]
