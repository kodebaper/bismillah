As usual, every time I post the latest articles or make periodic updates to changes to the blog, I always push to the GitHub Page with these 5 commands.\n# hugo # cd public/ # git add . # git commit -m \u0026quot;your-commit-order\u0026quot; # git push -u origin master From the commands I entered 1 to 4 it went as usual, but as soon as I entered the push command 5.\n# git push -u origin master I get an error message like this.\nerror: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/kodebaper/kodebaper.github.io.git' hint : Updates were rejected because the tip of your current branch is behind hint : 'git pul ...') before pushing again. The error message is more or less like the one above, what I always do every time I encounter an error is I will start reading the error messages given one by one. Because almost every time we use the Git service, we encounter problems, in my experience, error messages are definitely included, which will make it easier for us to trace errors so we can fix them. Another tip to make it easier for us to understand error messages is to try to learn English because understanding and being able to speak English will make it easier for us in all respects, moreover, in my opinion, most of the articles on the internet are available in English or for reading documentation.\nError can be resolved with this command Finally I got a solution to overcome the problem as above so we can push back to update to GitHub Page, this is the script\n# git pull --rebase And just using this command and problem is solved, I can push back to git, good luck!\n","date":"2024-06-26T11:27:01+07:00","image":"http://localhost:1313/p/error-failed-to-push-some-refs-to/gitrefs_hu044bf2ae48e238d1201bbb7c335dae7c_62194_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/p/error-failed-to-push-some-refs-to/","title":"Error Failed to Push Some Refs To"},{"content":"Main topic Get to know what is Cloudflare and right now I\u0026rsquo;m only using Cloudflare\u0026rsquo;s services to use the free service for setting up my blog\u0026rsquo;s DNS, while on another occasion I will discuss how to set DNS on Cloudflare from the Github page for Hugo\u0026rsquo;s blog static site.\nStarting from this blog, deploying it to the GitHub page and then ordering a Domaindotcom from Domainesia, at that time the custom domain setup at Cloudflare was taking place. In the middle of the journey, there was a problem with the process of calling the domain from the beginning mazzempong.github.io become santricyber.com because the results don\u0026rsquo;t just arrive at the custom domain on GitHub, but there is an advanced setup on Cloudflare. This is where I started learning and getting to know what Cloudflare is.\nSo, what is Cloudflare ? Cloudflare is a content delivery network service, Internet security prevention and distributed domains. Cloudflare products are intermediaries for web visitors, and hosting providers for Cloudflare users [Wikipedia version description]. I got this explanation from Wikipedia, but for myself I understand Cloudflare is a CDN (Content Delivery Network) where Cloudflare itself is between the domain name and web hosting which has the ability to filter traffic and accelerate website access. As for additional security provided by Cloudflare, one of them is security from DDoS attacks and so on.\nI just got to know Clodflare about 6 months ago and started to be familiar with some of the features in it, I used Cloudflare as part of the Setup series when I did a custom domain on the GitHub page with the domain dotcom. Isn\u0026rsquo;t it interesting to use Hugo? the more we dive in, the more we know a lot of knowledge, for example, we get to know what services are provided by Cloudflare, then for other benefits, including because we don\u0026rsquo;t just blog normally, but so there is additional knowledge that we learn by blogging through the satic site generator using Hugo.\nI hope this article is useful, happy reading and learning!\n","date":"2024-06-26T11:22:46+07:00","image":"http://localhost:1313/p/get-to-know-cloudflare-dns-service/cloudflaredns_hu36a76cd7c60cd28fe7c52c25e07b0bfa_60560_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/p/get-to-know-cloudflare-dns-service/","title":"Get to Know Cloudflare DNS Service"},{"content":"0. Tips for using templates made by other people In discussing this article, I will discuss the details of the template used on my current blog. But before discussing it, I also took the time to discuss tips on using templates made by other people so that we understand each section and its layout. Where are the things I do after downloading templates made by other people I will dissect and if necessary record the contents of the files in the template one by one.\nThen I will start reading and understanding the contents of the codes that are arranged in it, but the earliest thing I did at that time was to record the entire contents of the file in it, at least there are several points that I will discuss, including:\nWhat is the name of the template used? Why don\u0026rsquo;t I make my own template? What I did after finding the desired template. Okay, let\u0026rsquo;s discuss the 3 points above for more details about this template.\n1. What is the name of the template used? The template I\u0026rsquo;m currently using for Hugo\u0026rsquo;s blog is a template called Hago theme which I got for free [HERE] or you can download it by going to GitHub to the people behind the template maker [HERE]. I like this template because it\u0026rsquo;s simple, it reminds me of my habit of reading articles on well-known sitesMedium, simple but good for reading every content of the content in it because in my opinion the layout of each component is inMedium it\u0026rsquo;s neat and uncomplicated. That\u0026rsquo;s how I felt when I found this template. The features presented by the creator for this template include:\nResponsive web Tags Page Categories Page Google Analytics Comments jQuery 2.2.4 Bootstrap 4.4.1 Awsome Font 5.8.2 Is it enough to get here the features? of course not, yes there are some that we have to perfect and adjust to our wishes. The name alone is a template made by someone else, so we adjust it to the creator, then we just add it for improvement.\nThe advantages that I get by using templates made by other people are:\nSave time because I don\u0026rsquo;t make it from scratch\nFor beginners like me, it is very helpful to have a template like this where if I make it from scratch it will be more time consuming.\nI have new knowledge, as I said because I am still very new to the world of programming so I will be carried away to want to learn what is needed to make a template like the one I am using.\nWeaknesses by using templates created by other people include:\nThere are parts of the features in the template that are not what we want, this is certain because sometimes even though the front view of the template is what we want, there are other features that are far from our expectations.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s much more difficult to learn all the components that are built into the template because we didn\u0026rsquo;t design it from scratch.\nIn my opinion, a sense of satisfaction is lacking, because the overall content of the blog or the template is not entirely created by us.\n2. Why can\u0026rsquo;t I make my own template? actually before I used this template, I had the chance to make my own template by following the guide on making a template from scratch for Hugo where I got this guide from a blog that was both built using Hugo but I think this blog is very good and always motivates me to have blog class this blog that is [Petani Kode] After some consideration, I feel that I haven\u0026rsquo;t had the opportunity to continue making templates that I\u0026rsquo;ve made and then attaching them to this blog because I\u0026rsquo;m currently focusing on learning mobile programming using the Kotlin programming language.\nI thought I would break the focus if I built my own template but right now I\u0026rsquo;m still excited about learning Kotlin, so I finally decided to use a template made by someone else while when the time is possible I will update my blog to use a template made by myself, where I just perfecting the template that I had made before.\nThis is also more about time efficiency where the faster the blog that I build with Hugo, the faster I will document every new knowledge that I learn and put it in writing on this blog.\n3. What I did after finding the template I wanted. What needs to be understood after finding a template to your liking is not expecting it to be perfect for everything in the template, of course, because of course we need other changes from the template that we have downloaded or at least perfect the features because the templates that other people make are not necessarily the whole as expected. After point tips like at the beginning of this article I discussed where I already understood the entire contents of the file that created the template on this blog, what I did after finding the template I wanted was I started slowly to change some parts, as it seems now I can I feel that there has been a slight change in the appearance of the original template from its creator until now I am using it. Oh he did not forget I also added some parts of the script for needs THIS in some of these template files.\nHope this article helps, happy learning!\n","date":"2024-06-26T11:16:38+07:00","image":"http://localhost:1313/p/get-to-know-theme-on-the-hugo-static-website/hugotheme_hu6664fe954672aaccdbb456a1ab2b567c_32678_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/p/get-to-know-theme-on-the-hugo-static-website/","title":"Get to Know Theme on the Hugo Static Website"},{"content":"main topic The following are basic commands for using Git that are suitable for beginners to know and understand, more specifically for me personally because this article is one of the places where I summarize what I have learned\nThen I will periodically update this article by continuing a similar discussion to this article but with Git commands and other explanations as time goes by I use Git.

I will update this article with a more complete discussion at a later time with other tips on how to write articles on Hugo, while the tips that I wrote at this time are still limited to the whole ones that I use in writing on my current blog.\nTo remind you again, previously all of our article files or writings on the Hugo blog would be stored in the directory content with the file order like this\n[Hugo blog] ---\u0026gt; [content] | [blog/post] The way to write articles on blogs that use hugo / create articles through a text editor is as follows:\nInclude image files I usually use this script when we want to include a picture in an article post\n\u0026lt;img src=\u0026quot;/images/namagambar.png\u0026quot; align=\u0026quot;center\u0026quot;\u0026gt; all we have to do is adjust the image files where we will call them later using this script, usually the template folder will be stored in the static folder then the images folder where the image assets are stored.\nCreate a form script text I call it like that, because to be honest I\u0026rsquo;m still having a hard time and I haven\u0026rsquo;t found an article that discusses writing articles on Hugo. Okay, so we use this to make the writing in black form, usually in articles there are times when we want to write a script between the posts in the article, we need to make it different from normal writing.\nto make it very easy, we simply advance the writing/script that we will enter into the black form by pressing the Tab key 2x then writing or pasting the writing.\nMark text with rounded dots For this one I usually use it to describe many sub-subheadings, for example I\u0026rsquo;m describing the types of the Debian linux operating system and its derivatives, so I will mention the Debian operating system by starting [ROUND POINT] before the name of the operating system, an example is as follows.\nLinux Ubuntu\nLinux Mint\nKali Linux\netc\nCan you see the round dot before the word \u0026ldquo;Linux\u0026rdquo; ? well I mean like that. For bloggers To make it very easy, we just need to give a sign [-] before the sentence we will give a round dot\nMakes the title underlined In this function I will give tips on how to make a large underlined title in the article or subtitles in each post. For more details, for example like this, I embed sub-headings in each article.\nexample subtitles 1 line example subtitles 2 lines Like this, as for making it also simple, namely giving a sign [##] in any desired title. for more details see the picture below.\nBut if we don\u0026rsquo;t want a line under the title, then we just need to remove one mark**#** before the title. Thus, for this article, I will end it here and in the future I will update other tips on how to write articles on blogs using Hugo ssg.

Where do you do it from? namely through monitoring the Bounce Rate onGoogle Analytic, now the function is to make external links to be able to open in new tabs will lower the numberbounce rate quality on Google Analytic\nAs for the way like this, create a file namedrender-link.html in your theme layouts folder.

Setting up the domain Make sure you have bought a domain, yes, if you are using a paid domain. here I document my preparations before doing a custom domain on the github page using a paid domain, I bought the .com domain at Domainesia , this will also affect the DNS Management settings which later we have to change where in this case I changed my default nameserver from Domainesia to the nameserver recommended by cloudflare because I also use cloudflare for DNS management .\n2. Read Documentation This is very important, yes, you need to understand before doing a custom domain, because at this stage we will make some changes that you may not understand properly, such as understanding DNS management, what is changing nameservers to direct your initial domain to a new domain, you might I don\u0026rsquo;t really understand CNAME settings, or SSL activation.\nI have included the documentation here to serve as a guide for you to learn, yes, you need to understand, the method I use for the sequence is more or less so that you understand the sequence,\n[I bought a domain \u0026mdash;\u0026gt; after my domain was activated by Domainesia \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; I used Cloudflare for DNS management then I ADD DOMAIN on Cloudlfare \u0026mdash;\u0026gt; I made a nameserver change from Cloudflare to my Domainesia Dashboard \u0026mdash; \u0026gt; then I custom domain on the github page of the main repository]`\nmore or less the order is like this, then I will describe in more detail the steps for custom domain on the github page for my hugo blog on another occasion.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s the documentation that you can read to be your guide.\nFirst guide: https://docs.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site\nSecond guide: https://docs.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/managing-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site\nI think these two documentation modals are enough, because they are very detailed and complete as a guide for customizing your domain on the github page.\n3. Already registered an account on the CLoudflare service We recommend that you first create an account at Cloudflare, it\u0026rsquo;s very easy to create because it only requires an email for the registration process and account activation later. Then you are here using the free service provided by Cloudflare like I did, but for paid packages if you want it is also available. This preparation is important to speed up the custom domain process because after the domain we bought is active then we can immediately register our domain on the Cloudflare service.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s all for this article, I highly recommend this preparation to be fulfilled in order to facilitate our learning process to experiment with Hugo and GitHub Pages.

I really feel that as you continue to monitor activity on a blog with Analytic, all kinds of possibilities open up, starting from content that must be continuously optimized, improving effective code writing to changing the appearance of a blog that is as simple as possible but still looks good.\nThere are at least three review points that I wrote according to my experience using Analytic tools from Google for my blog, in the future I will always update articles that always discuss the development of my * static blog * in optimizing with simple SEO techniques.

Then when I opened my blog using an internet connection at the office, I had to go through verification which stated that the page being opened was not secure. I also don\u0026rsquo;t understand the Fortigate firewall device in the office where I work, doing verification like this on my blog.\nproblem As for problem solvers to overcome this problem as follows:\nFirst delete the domain on the GitHub Page\nI first delete the domain name that I entered in the GitHub Page settings, delete it then save it, just leave it blank first. In the example in the image below, I deleted the domain santricyber.com ---\u0026gt; then SAVE \u0026ldquo;adjust to your domain name to delete first okay\u0026rdquo;\nUp here it\u0026rsquo;s finished for matters of setting up domains on the GitHub Page.\nResetting the Management DNS on CloudFlare after that I went to the settings on Management DNS on CloudFlare because from some of the references I read it was not the same as the settings from the DNS side that I did, then I made changes to DNS on CloudFlare\nThe configuration is at least as described below.\n\u0026lt;\u0026lt;Settings while still wrong\u0026gt;\u0026gt; ------------------------------ \u0026lt;Type\u0026gt; \u0026lt;Name\u0026gt; \u0026lt;Content\u0026gt; \u0026lt;TTL\u0026gt; \u0026lt;Proxy Status\u0026gt; A www 185.199.108.153 Auto Proxied CNAME santricyber.com santricyber.github.io Auto Proxied TXT santricyber.com google-site...... Auto DNS Only From the settings for DNS on CloudFlare like this, of course it\u0026rsquo;s not quite right, and results in the HTTPS activated in the custom domain settings on the github page for that it returns me study the documentation that is widely scattered on the internet in the arrangement between custom domains on GitHub and DNS Management on CloudFlare. Okay until here it\u0026rsquo;s done,\nReturn to custom domain settings on GitHub Page\nAfter the second point above is finished, now what I do is fill in the domain name that previously did not want to \u0026lsquo;checklist\u0026rsquo; the Enforce HTTPS, after filling it in then save it, after that we have to wait for the change to HTTPS and this feature cannot be checked yet because it takes time. After waiting about 20 minutes, I refreshed the custom domain page on GitHub and Enforce HTTPS can be activated by placing a check in the Enforce HTTPS section and changing the description on the custom domain GitHub Page to Your site is published at https http://santricyber.com/.\nUntil these three processes are completed, and problems like this are not always faced. Because in some cases custom domains on GitHub Pages can run smoothly without going through a process like this.

On this articles, we will get to know more about what Hugo static site generator is and the 5 main reasons I chose to blog using Hugo.\nThis started with my strong desire to learn programming where I tried to get out of my scientific routine which was more involved with Networking, so I finally decided to learn trending programming, namely programming for mobile apps. Where the first step I took was to create a personal blog as my own personal record of how far I would learn mobile application programming. The first programming lesson that I will learn and document is the Kotlin programming language.\nAfter quite a process of looking for references here and there regarding the blog engine that I will use, finally I found a static site from Hugo as my choice to start a blog to document what I learn and indeed my hobbies are reading and writing, Of the many types Finally, my static site generator prefers Hugo.\nwhat is hugo static website? Hugo claims to be the fastest SSG framework at the moment, but for myself who is still very new to the world of programming, the world of website or framework development, of course I am very enthusiastic about that statement, where in the future I will try and prove the statement as stated on the official Hugo website itself.\nthen what is hugo?\nHugo is a static web generator written in the Go programming language. Hugo was developed by BjÃ¸rn Erik Pedersen, Steve Francia, and other contributors. Hugo is an open source project under the Apache 2.0 License (Wikipedia\u0026rsquo;s answer). So basically Hugo is essentially a popular open-source framework for building a website, we can make this even if we are just getting into the world of blogging or just learning programming where Hugo himself makes it very simple, I only need a text editor and a terminal which is basically default already installed on my laptop operating system.\nSo what made me choose Hugo? Hugo is lightweight and easy to learn even by beginners. This is my personal opinion\nThe large community is the reason why I chose Hugo, because every problem or obstacle we face in the Hugo Community forums is sure to be mostly discussed.\nComplete documentation on Hugo\u0026rsquo;s official website, this is one of my favorites. I can freely start practicing building a website just by following the complete documentation on the Hugo website. Even to make a template according to my own wishes, I just have to follow the documentation available on the official Hugo website.\nThe reason for the budget limit is that you don\u0026rsquo;t want to bother renting a hosting service. I myself only have the capital to buy a domain, so how about hosting? Don\u0026rsquo;t worry because at Hugo there are many options for hosting, we can take advantage of free services such as GitHub, GitLab, Forestry or Netlify and many more. And all that we can get with the free service.\nBecome smarter, if this is what it has to do with it? I take an example from my own simple blog. Maybe for a website master, making a static site website with Hugo might be very easy, even for making templates. But this does not apply to a beginner like me, or those of you who are just starting to become a web developer. From Hugo we can understand the directory of a website, like it or not we start to know what GIT is, and over time we are faced with having to understand several programming languages â€‹â€‹to make our own templates. Interesting right ? without realizing it, as time goes by, we begin to understand the world of websites, it remains only for us to develop the knowledge we have acquired to continue to hone our skills.\n","date":"2024-06-25T16:08:28+07:00","image":"http://localhost:1313/p/what-is-hugo-static-site-generator/whathugo_huc87b231f342397336321204b1fba34d9_52244_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/p/what-is-hugo-static-site-generator/","title":"What Is Hugo Static Site Generator?"},{"content":"I use Linux because I want to learn . The main reason I chose the Ubuntu Linux operating system to install on my first notebook was, I was inspired by several technological devices that were built using the Linux operating system, one of which was where various technology servers were built. and developed using the Linux operating system (at that time I read git anyway). But the main point of all this is not here, I feel that Linux is my operating system of choice because besides continuing my education to the SMK level majoring in Computer and Network Engineering, I also have never operated a computer or laptop at all.\nThen what does the choice of \u0026ldquo;Ubuntu\u0026rdquo; linux have to do with the school major I took at the SMK Computer Network Engineering level and have never operated a computer?\nI came up with the idea after researching the Linux operating system, that later by using Linux I would learn a lot with that operating system, then with my drawback that at that time I had never used a computer/laptop at all I don\u0026rsquo;t know, I still don\u0026rsquo;t know the differences between the existing operating systems. Like comparing between Linux, Windows and Mac OS. So whether it\u0026rsquo;s difficult or not, Linux has actually led me to keep learning until I can and start to understand the characteristics of the Linux operating system that I use.\nWhat did I get after that?\nSure enough, both subjects at Vocational Schools regarding programming, networking, I was greatly helped by the Linux Ubuntu that I used on my laptop, because there were lots of tutorials and lessons that were actually practiced using the operating system Linux in every article.\nFor you, the reason for migration is because of what? I hope that for those of you who want to migrate using the Linux operating system because you have a willingness to learn to deepen certain disciplines, this is not only because you have the reason that you want to use legal software, right, because you will definitely get this! and helping our country, of course, so that other countries get a bad image that Indonesians like to use pirated software, and the fact is that our country was once in the top ranking (forgot what order I was in) that this country is one of the countries with the largest users of pirated software\u0026hellip;. sad huh.\nOkay, let\u0026rsquo;s come back Let me take an easy example\u0026hellip;\nDo you want to master skills in server development?\nOr study cloud technology, which is currently increasingly trending and requires experts in the field of cloud servers.... .?\nIf so, this is the best step for you to decide to start focusing and pursuing learning with the Linux operating system, because from here the two questions above will be answered.\nOr even if you want to become an Security Engineer , then migrating to the Linux operating system, and learning the basics of the Linux operating system and then learning more is the solution.\nI draw conclusions here !!! That those of you who want to learn Linux and choose a distro that you really think are suitable to be your first choice distro for migrating to the Linux operating system, instill a strong intention to really learn about the knowledge you will learn. Then in essence you have strong goals and future goals why the Linux system you chose to migrate.\n","date":"2024-06-25T15:55:32+07:00","image":"http://localhost:1313/p/why-i-install-and-learn-ubuntu-in-my-laptop/ubuntu_hu044bf2ae48e238d1201bbb7c335dae7c_43206_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/p/why-i-install-and-learn-ubuntu-in-my-laptop/","title":"Why I Install and Learn Ubuntu in My Laptop"},{"content":"main topic Finally, from CMS, I decided to use a framework that is said to be the fastest framework.

My answer is that I am quite comfortable and I know more about what my own blog is like, know the mechanics of my own blog from when I made it offline, until I deployed it on GitHub, so I know what Git is, so I know how to order a domain from a service provider and then change it to settings on the Github page, so I quite understand the DNS settings on the cloudflare service for my personal blog.\nFor me, Hugo himself is one of the reasons I now like the world of programming where my background is more focused on learning networking from when I was still in Vocational High School and currently working in the world of Networking. I felt that I had to start learning from the beginning about HTML, CSS, and BOOTSTRAP (because of the template requirements that I now install on this blog using Bootstrap).\nThat\u0026rsquo;s all for discussing my first reason, maybe where I finally chose Hugo to be a personal blogging machine, happy learning!\n","date":"2024-06-25T15:40:54+07:00","image":"http://localhost:1313/p/why-migrate-to-hugo/gohugo_hu8ad81f8bf1ffea27b584a38ec58318ff_64660_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/p/why-migrate-to-hugo/","title":"Why Migrate to Hugo"},{"content":"explaintation about this series It should be remembered that this article is a series of lessons from part 1 on ethical hacking to part 7 that I studied, to summarize so that there is not too much discussion I decided to shorten the discussion\nArticles on the hacking series are not recommended for those who are very beginners, I do not explain with detailed pictures or videos and also do not explain the basics of the Kali Linux operating system starting from how to change directories and run the command line. I hope those who study this hacking series are familiar with open-source operating systems so that further on in the next part you won\u0026rsquo;t experience too many difficulties.\nparts 1 to part 7 are as follows This article is a summary of the discussion on ethical hacking material in parts 1 to part 7 that I have learned, while the points that I got during learning parts 1 to part 7 are as follows:\ninstall virtual box and prepare virtual machine installation of kali linux os in vm understanding the basic Kali Linux commands and studying the directories and contents inside the characteristics of the Kali Linux operating system. ethical hacking session starting from information gathering just the first stage of information in learning to do hacking after all the preparations have been completed starting from reconnaissance or gathering information (information gathering)\nIn the information gathering that must be identified, namely the IP address of the attack target, physical address, email address, username, etc. They also use tools like whois, what web, theharvester, hunter.io, or Sherlock. it also includes making its tools with the Python programming language to find out the location of the target server of the attack target in this case a website.\nthe earliest stage of preparation for learning ethical hacking is preparing a virtual machine in which we will embed a special operating system to carry out hacking activities. After the vm is installed on a laptop or computer device, then install the Kali Linux operating system on the vm.\nvirtual machine vm has been installed, and we have also installed the operating system for carrying out the attack, let\u0026rsquo;s now it\u0026rsquo;s time to explore and understand how to use the Kali Linux operating system. This stage is carried out for those who don\u0026rsquo;t understand and are new to Kali Linux. There\u0026rsquo;s no need to rush into the hacking part immediately, but need help understanding how to use the Kali Linux operating system as the most basic and primary weapon. Therefore, first, get to know what Kali Linux is, learn all the existing directories and the functions of each directory, get to know the command lines for editing files, creating files, deleting files, and moving directories to other directories (this method is the most basic and mandatory in know and understand) after all this you can and get used to letting\u0026rsquo;s shorten the time to carry out hacking activities by starting to enter the next step\nwe will proceed to the information gathering step first, in this session we will create a program with the Python programming language which we will run then the program will be able to track the location of the server a website is placed on, in this case, this information starts from obtaining information IP Address then the location information.\nfor that, I will continue making this program in the discussion of articles in the next part.

Until the discussion of this article is here, I will continue the discussion of information gathering in the next article\n","date":"2019-03-05T00:00:00Z","image":"http://localhost:1313/p/how-to-track-an-ip-checker-tool-in-python/recon3_hu889f54b6541cd963dfcd75a2f95f6ed5_38566_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/p/how-to-track-an-ip-checker-tool-in-python/","title":"how to track an IP checker tool in python"}]
