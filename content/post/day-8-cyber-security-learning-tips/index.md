### Main Topics
Until learning on day 8 there are several learning resources that I apply in learning **penetration testing**, including:

1. Bootcamp

    This learning source is the first thing in learning penetration testing, I do this because learning in Bootcamp I can be directed in learning, learning resources that I don't know yet I can learn through Bootcamp, a structured curriculum in Bootcamp also makes us more directed in learning. Avoiding us in achieving a goal without using the wrong path or avoiding learning that is not on target.

2. Discord

    The next learning to learn Penetration testing is, I can take advantage of community forums on discord to be able to learn, such as the CTF (Capture The Flag) community forum or the Bug finder community forum. No need to hesitate to join and then follow all the rules in the forum. After that, read whatever is shared by each community member because from there the source of knowledge will be easy for us to learn and apply.

3. POC on Discord

    This is the most fun learning resource according to me, we only need to read every BUG finding that has been found by every member in the community, in POC usually every community member who finds a system security gap or BUG they will share the journey of finding BUG and how to get it.

4. Cyber Security Website

    Read any website or blog that discusses cyber security, especially with the learning target that we are currently studying, because reading sources or knowledge on the internet through documentation notes in the form of websites or blogs are very banya. After that, apply the Learning method by reading then practicing.

5. Youtube

    Many Youtube channels discuss cyber security, watching videos on YouTube as a means of learning is one option, with a note that you don't need to waste too much time constantly watching videos but try watching a video once and then practicing.

These are some of the sources that have become my learning sources to understand and explore cyber security, especially in the penetration testing section. 

Thank you and we will meet in the next article.
