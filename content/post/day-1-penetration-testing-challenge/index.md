### Cyber Security Basics
In this first meeting I learned the basics of cyber security where the initial stage that was introduced was to recognize how I had to understand and know

1. what is cyber security
2. what is penetration testing
3. what must be prepared if you become a penetration tester
4. what tools are used if you want to become a penetration tester
5. The roadmap that must be followed if you want to become a penetration tester

### 12 Years more experience with linux operating system
I myself have more than 12 years of experience in using the Linux operating system for daily use, so I have no difficulty in being introduced to the Kali Linux operating system as the main weapon for carrying out hacking activities. I can have enough time to go to the next step in learning penetration testing using Kali Linux.

It should be known that in the knowledge of the Kali Linux operating system to make it easier to learn Penetration Testing we must be familiar with the Kali Linux operating system itself, such as knowing the Terminal application, Knowing the Directory structure in the Kali Linux operating system and its functions, knowing the Super User and Ordinary User on the terminal. And last but not least, we must be familiar with commands on the terminal to run a function or execute a file or directory, recognize the install system, application packages and update system of the Kali Linux operating system itself.


### Get to know Ethical Hacking
I fully understand the use of the term HACKING for me will often be considered by most people with illegal activities by digitally harming or harming others, for that with this good opportunity to learn hacking I must know the fundamentals of a HACKING activity, especially in ETHICAL HACKING activities as a Penetration Tester.


### Know what Red Team and Blue Team are
The use of the terms Red Team and Blue Team for me is to simplify the Scope that activities in the world of Hacking must have 2 idela types, first as a person who conducts a series of security tests of a system by carrying out attacks in various ways, which I then understand as a Red Team. Then there is one side of the person who secures a digital asset to secure it from cyber attacks and identify and respond quickly if the secured digital asset is hacked or attacked from outside, this is what I then understand as a Blue Team.

Then which position are you in now? Red Team or Blue Team......

If you arrived at this blog and read the Hacking Series article that I wrote, welcome you will be together with me to navigate step by step to become a Read Team Pentester.


### Get to know the elements of information security
In an information security should have 3 important information elements that must include in it, namely:
1. Confidentiality
    This is an effort to maintain the confidentiality of data from unauthorized parties to our data or digital assets that we have or we keep.

2. Integrity
    This is an effort to maintain the authenticity of the data or digital assets that we maintain and we have so that they cannot be changed by people who do not have the authority to do so.

3. Availability
    This is an effort to create information that can be accessed anytime and anywhere.


### Basic concepts for learning hacking 
The basic concept for learning Hacking in my first perception of learning it is to understand and master the following:
1. Network Fundamentals
2. Operating System
3. Programming/Scripting
4. Database

This knowledge will cover a large scale and more in-depth than the 4 points above, for example I recommend to understand and understand Network Fundamentals, which means we must know the types of Internet Connections, network topologies, IP types, Subneting, OSI LAYERS and IP Address classes. This also applies to knowing more about Operating System, Programming, and Database.

Last ###
This is the first concept of understanding knowledge that I knew on the first day of learning Ethical Hacking as a Penetration Testing. Everyone's views and knowledge will certainly be different in the order of learning to become a Penetration Tester. Happy learning and we will meet in the next article series.
