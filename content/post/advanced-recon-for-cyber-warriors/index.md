**IMPORTANT! Notes on ethical hacking series**

>### I am not asking you to commit cybercrime nor am I teaching you to do so,...
>
>### Although I like the command line, free open source software, Linux, etc. You won't find any illegal activities on this web site.

 although in this series there is a discussion about hacking but hacking in the sense of ethical hacking to build awareness of the security side in cyberspace and learning, the writings that I make are purely as a record of the results of my knowledge and in share for purposes that I hope will be useful to anyone who reads it with good intentions including increasing awareness of security in cyberspace and overcoming losses due to cybercrime.

>### so that all forms of abuse in the use of all the writing I load are beyond my control and responsibility as the author of articles on this website. keep learning and provide benefits and use knowledge wisely!!!
